	List of changes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.2h to 0.2i

       Renamed most source files to fit into 8.3 characters and less.  Sorry.

       Changes by Davide Moretti <dmoretti@iper.net>: Incorporated the
       changes to allow TiMidity to compile and run under Win32 platforms
       (tested with Windows 95 and Windows NT for Intel).  Read README.W32
       for more information.

       Tcl/Tk interface by Takashi Iwai <iwai@dragon.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp>.
       Read README.tk.

       DEC port by Chi Ming HUNG <cmhung@insti.physics.sunysb.edu>.  Read
       README.DEC.

       A few bugfixes: WAVE headers, shell substitution, Linux audio O_RDWR,
       dumb/ncurses segfault (thanks to everyone who sent a fix for this ;)

       Reversed the sense of the -F option to get rid of some nasty pops.

       Attempted to merge Makefile.{SUN|SOLARIS|HPUX|DEC} back into Makefile
       to conserve the world's ketoprofen reserves.

       Lowered default amplification to 70% to get a bit more dynamic
       headroom.

0.2g to 0.2h

       Warning! This is a Vincent Pagel release... more official
       release when Tuukka comes back from hollydays, err, his
       exams actually.

       I've added a Motif interface with files selection, time scale
       cursor and other blue widgets. More gadgets to come. Changes
       are in motif_* files, but also a big structure change in
       timidity.c and playmidi.c as it is now the interface that
       choose the name of the next file to play.

       Added so called "nice" icons

       Pipe communication between Motif interface and the program.

       Antialiasing filtering now works even with looping patch, nice
       when playing on a SUN at Ulaw at 8Khz ( option -a )

       Added a Makefile.HPUX since make on HP does not understand
       the += notation

       Thanks to Gilles Dauphin, works on Solaris

0.2f to 0.2g

	Wrote a little WAVE to patch converter and added ".wav" to
	DECOMPRESSOR_LIST to allow using wave files as simple
	instruments. This was Davor Jadrijevic's suggestion from some
	time back. New file: wav2pat.c

	Took out ADJUST_PANNING_IMMEDIATELY and put in a command line
	option "-F" for "turn off _F_ast panning". Running out of
	letters for command line options.

	Error check in read_config_file to make some noise when
	directories are specified as config files.

	Squashed a segfault that resulted from resampling past loop
	end (FINALINTERP, when incr > 1<<FRACTION_BITS).

	Sweep computation overflow with seashore.pat fixed.

	The portion of sample data from loop_end to data_length is now
	played if the instrument doesn't have a loop or an envelope.
	Some patches (e.g. Fretnoyz from the ProPats 3.0 set) contain
	garbage between loop_end and data_length, so there's a new
	config file option "strip=tail" to drop it off.

	Reverse loops are now done "right".

	Slight LOOKUP_HACK cleanup. There's a "final_volume_t" type
	that's either an uint8 or an int32, whichever is required for
	mixing computations, and a FINAL_VOLUME() macro to convert an
	int32 to the required type.

	Changed the "THING := $(THING) junk" assignments in Makefile
	to "THING += junk"'s. Hopefully the latter is understood by
	more makes than the former. The whole mess will be replaced by
	a configure script within a few releases.

	Split up mix_data in mix.c to make it easier to look at.

0.2e to 0.2f

	Moved mixing functions out of resample.c. New files: mix.c,
	mix.h.

	Added midia.cfg config file for the Midia patch set.

	Added Shawn McHorse's loop optimizations and LOOKUP_SINE
	config.h option.

	Added Shawn's FAST_DECAY command line switch -- config.h
	option FAST_DECAY now sets the default for this switch.

	USE_LDEXP config.h option, in case your compiler converts
	ldexp() into a straight fscale, and fscale is faster than fmul
	on your machine.

	Fixed WAVE header bug -- the lengths were 44 bytes short.
	Thanks to Alexey Marinichev for noticing.

	Added PATCH_EXT_LIST option to config.h, so you don't have to
	change every filename in your configuration file when you
	decide to compress your patches.

	Added external utility "bag". New file: bag.c, read it for
	info.

	Added "extern" to the s32towhatever() prototypes in output.h.

0.2d to 0.2e

	Riccardo Facchetti's S-Lang-based user interface: a more
	efficient alternative to ncurses. Options in Makefile.

	Rearranged options in Makefile to make various combinations
	easier to select.

	LOOKUP_HACK config file option: horrible experimental kludge
	to substitute table lookups for multiplication. First attempt
	to use uLaw as sample format failed miserably. Now using 8-bit
	linear, which is fine for Sound Blaster owners. It only saves
	~20% of CPU on a Pentium, but let me know what it does to your
	setup.

	Changed instrument loading to add the Sustain flag to all
	patches which have the Looped flag set.

	Implemented All Notes Off, All Sounds Off, and Reset All
	Controllers events. The Day of the Tentacle intro music uses
	the first and plays OK now. The other two might work, or they
	might throw your machine into a damaging infinite binary loop.

	Implemented Bank Select controller. Sort of emulates the SCC-1
	(I think): use Control Change 00 xx, where xx is the tone bank
	you want.  Totally untested. Some MIDI files use Control
	Change 0 for something else, generating loads of warnings.

	In config.h, changed the default command line for shorten to
	work with version 1.22. The old one was for some ancient
	version which I finally got around to replacing.

	Fencepost error in resampling fixed by Vincent Pagel.

	Fixed problem with bidirectional loops and vibrato.

0.2c to 0.2d

	Volume computations rewritten to use both floating point and
	integer multiplication.

	Tremolo and vibrato handling. Some tuning parameters are
	available in config.h.

	Fixed-pitch, non-looped instruments are now resampled at load
	time.  Note that fixed-pitch instruments can't be pitch-bent.

	Cheaper click removal scheme. Removed I_WANT_THE_CLICKS_BACK
	option from config.h, added MAX_DIE_TIME definition. Moved
	resampling and mixing functions from playmidi.{c,h} to new
	files: resample.c, resample.h.

	Percussion instrument pitches can now be specified
	independently of the note they're assigned to. Melodic
	instrument pitches can also be forced. Extra options in config
	file -- see the manual. Thanks to Davor Jadrijevic for his
	suggestions.

	Loops and envelopes are now removed from all percussion
	instruments by default. This should eliminate cymbal crashes
	being cut short.

	Changes in gravis.cfg to override some instrument parameters
	that would be guessed incorrectly.

	Vincent Pagel's experimental antialiasing filter. This doesn't
	interact very well with looping yet, so it's only applied to
	non-looped instruments. Use the command line option "-a" to
	enable the filter. New files: filtering.c, filtering.h.

	Enabled fast forward & rewind in non-trace mode in
	ncurses_ctl.c.

	Fixed a problem with envelopes -- envelope handling still
	isn't perfect, but skipping the "Attack 2" phase was dumb.

	Added ADJUST_PANNING_IMMEDIATELY to config.h, default on (no
	change from previous behavior).

	Silly bug in adjusting non-enveloped voice volumes fixed.

	Small change in ncurses_ctl to display 100 for maximum volume
	and expression.

	After listening to a GUS, made FAST_DECAY default to on.

	Riccardo Facchetti's patch to config.h: Not all Linux systems
	are little-endian.

	Riccardo's alternative keyboard commands in ncurses_ctl.c.
	First step towards porting to MS Windows -- you can press
	F1 to get help!

	DANGEROUS_RENICE config.h option. Thanks again to Riccardo.

0.2b to 0.2c

	Fixed pitch bend sensitivity again. NRPN controls are now
	correctly ignored.

0.2a to 0.2b

	Francesco Zanichelli's patches to get the Sun version to
	actually compile.

	Victor Langeveld's patches to get the FreeBSD version to
	actually compile.

	Fixed pitch bend sensitivity. Thanks again to Vincent Pagel
	for the information.

	Expression now defaults to 127, as with the SCC-1. Some things
	may sound a bit loud.

0.1a to 0.2a

	Internal changes for easier porting to other systems.
	long long's are gone, floating point is used instead.
	Command line options changed.

	Output to HP-UX audio server by Vincent Pagel.

	Output to Sun audio device based on Francesco Zanichelli's
	port of version 0.1a.

	Output to ZyXEL modems based on Rob Janssen's uLaw patches.

	FreeBSD options in Makefile and linux_audio.c. Check for DSP
	fragment capability. (Thanks to Victor Langeveld.)

	ncurses interface changes. Trace mode optional.

	Fixed bug -- the last MIDI event was getting eaten, causing
	stuck notes at the end of songs. (Reported by Anthony Cruz.)

	Pitch-bend sensitivity added, with a hack to process "Data
	entry (MSB)" events. Thanks to Vincent Pagel for info on
	this...

	Run-time configuration of quiet and percussion channels.

	Volume computation fix. You can now crank the volume up to
	800%.

	Slower envelopes. Pianos sound better, harps sound
	worse. Applause in Beethoven's 5th should sound
	better... Thanks to Tim Norman for comments on this.
	CPU usage went up -- see option FAST_DECAY in config.h.

	Panning and volume controls no longer affect notes that have
	already been turned off.

	Click reduction on by default. CPU usage went up -- see option
	I_WANT_THE_CLICKS_BACK in config.h.

	Sample volume adjustment into compile time option -- see
	option ADJUST_SAMPLE_VOLUMES in config.h

	SMPTE time in divisions field in MThd. Untested.

	Quote some special characters in filenames before popen().

	Hack to accept old patch files and files that claim to contain
	0 instruments and/or layers.

	Behavior when reading Gravis .cfg files changed -- syntax
	error reported instead of segmentation fault.

0.1a
	First release. Plays MIDI files under Linux.
